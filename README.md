# Interstellar Navigation Project

In this project, you will create algorithms to navigate your spaceship through an asteroid field. To do this, you will need to learn about different pathfinding and collision detection techniques.

## Setup

Make sure python is installed on your computer. For this project, you will need to install pygame, which can be done with `pip3 install pygame`

## Getting Started

Take a look at the attached python code in `navigation.py`. Try running it, and see what happens (you can do this by navigating to this directory in your terminal and typing `python3 navigation.py`). You should see your rocket, your goal, and the field of asteroids you will need to navigate to.

## First steps

In the file `navigation.py`, you will see many empty methods. In order to successfully navigate the asteroid field without crashing, you will probably want to know if you are about to collide with an asteroid on any side of your ship. To figure this out, fill in the four methods, topCollision, bottomCollision, etc.
